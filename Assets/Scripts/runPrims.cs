/* Not implemented but some thoughts:
 * When the button is clicked, a pop up appears to tell the user to select a vertex
 * it will continue to display until the user selects a vertex (and then the algorithm will run) or the user clicks cancel
 * if the algorithm runs, the results will be displayed to the user
 * pop-up will most likely be over the algorithms panel to not interfere with the graph
