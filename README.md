## Project Description
Graph-It is a graph theory toolbox and graph visualization application that is created in Unity. The purpose of the project is to provide users of the application, such a students or researchers, a time-saving solution for the creation of graphs and for running various algorithms on the graphs.

Users are able to create graphs through various methods. Graph-It allows users to create vertices and edges individually, create a graph from a list of presets, or import a file of an existing graph. Graph-It also provides graph customization features such as vertex and edges styles, colors, and labels for the vertices and edges. Users are then able to save graphs as a picture (.png or .jpeg) or export the graph as a file.

Additional features include displaying updated information about the graph, such as the number of vertices, the number of edges, the chromatic number, and whether the graph is bipartite. Graph-It also provides multiple algorithms for users to run on their graph. Some of the algorithms include algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees, shortest paths, Eulerian circuits, and maximal matchings. The results of the algorithms will be highlighted on the graph, which then can be saved.

Graph-It provides a convenient and efficient solution for users to create graphs and run algorithms on the graphs. Users will not need to draw the graphs or run various algorithms on the graphs by hand, thus saving time.
